## 😫 The Problem

### Section Title
**Tired of juggling a million tabs?**

**Body Copy:**

You've got work to do. But instead of doing it, you're:

- 🔍 **Googling for hours** trying to find the right information
- ✍️ **Writing emails and reports** that eat up your whole day
- 📋 **Copy-pasting between tools** like a human robot
- 🧠 **Trying to remember everything** (spoiler: you can't)

What if you had a team that handled the boring stuff while you focused on what actually matters?

## ✨ The Solution

**Meet Your AI Team**

## 🤔 FAQ

### **What is this, exactly?**
It's like having a team of personal assistants you can message on Telegram. They use AI to help you research, write, organize, and automate stuff. Think of it as ChatGPT, but with more features and it lives in your messaging app.

### **Do I need to download anything?**
Nope! If you have Telegram (which is free), you're all set. Just search for the bot and start chatting.

### **Is it hard to use?**
If you can text, you can use this. Seriously. Just ask for what you need in plain English.

### **What can it actually do?**
A lot. Here are some examples:
- "Find me 5 article ideas about productivity"
- "Draft a professional email declining this meeting"
- "Summarize this article: [link]"
- "Remind me to follow up with John in 3 days"
- "What's the weather like this weekend?"
- "Compare iPhone 15 vs Samsung S24"

If you can describe it, there's a good chance your AI team can handle it.

### **What's the difference between Free and Pro?**
**Free:** 50 messages/month. Great for light use.  
**Pro:** Unlimited messages, faster responses, advanced features like file uploads and automation.

Think of it like this: Free tier is for kicking the tires. Pro tier is for people who want their AI team working for them every day.

### **How does billing work?**
Simple. You get a 7-day free trial of Pro when you sign up. After that, it's $10/month. Cancel anytime—no contracts, no BS.

### **Is my data private?**
Yes. We don't sell your data or use it to train models for other people. Your conversations stay between you and your AI team. Full privacy policy [here].

### **Can I use this for work?**
Absolutely. People use it for client emails, research, meeting prep, content writing, data gathering—you name it. Just remember: your AI team is a helper, not a replacement for your brain. Always review important stuff.

### **What if I need help?**
Just ask! Your AI team can help you figure out what it can do. Or message our support (also on Telegram, because why not).

### **Can I cancel anytime?**
Yep. No hard feelings. You can cancel your Pro subscription whenever you want. You'll keep access until the end of your billing period.

### **Will this replace my job?**
No. But it might make you so much better at your job that you get a promotion. 😎

### **This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?**
No catch. AI technology has gotten really good, and we're making it accessible. The "catch" is that you still need to tell your team what to do—it's not psychic (yet).

# Product Brief: Multi-Agent AI System

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Author:** Product Agent  
**Status:** Draft v1

---

## Executive Summary

We're selling a **production-ready blueprint** for building autonomous AI agent teams on OpenClaw. Not a framework. Not a SaaS. A **proven architecture + templates** that anyone with OpenClaw can deploy in an hour.

The core insight: multi-agent orchestration shouldn't require code. It should be as simple as copying files and customizing prompts.

---

## 1. What Is the Product?

### Core Offering: Agent Blueprint Kit

A complete, copy-paste system for deploying hierarchical AI agent teams:

- **Architecture design** (strategic → orchestrator → specialists)
- **SOUL templates** for each agent role
- **Gateway configurations** (ready-to-use JSON)
- **Cron job schedules** (morning briefs, weekly audits)
- **Memory patterns** (cross-agent coordination)
- **Use-case examples** (executive assistant, content ops, research team)

**Delivery format:** GitHub repo (open source, MIT license)

### What It Is NOT

- ❌ A SaaS product (no hosted service)
- ❌ A code framework (no SDK, no libraries)
- ❌ A managed service (users run it themselves)
- ❌ A course (it's a system, not curriculum)

### Add-On Opportunities (Later)

| Add-on | Revenue Model | Priority |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Premium templates (industry-specific) | One-time purchase | Medium |
| Video tutorials/course | One-time or subscription | Low |
| Consulting/setup services | Hourly/project | Medium |
| Custom agent development | Project-based | High-margin |

## 2. Who Is the Primary Customer?

### Primary: Technical Power Users

**Profile:**
- Already using OpenClaw (or evaluating it)
- Comfortable editing JSON and markdown files
- Want AI automation but not building from scratch
- Solopreneurs, indie hackers, technical founders
- Power users managing personal or small business operations

**Technical Level:** Medium  
- Can follow terminal instructions
- Can edit config files
- Does NOT need to write code

### Secondary: OpenClaw Newbies

People discovering OpenClaw who want a "what can I do with this?" answer. The blueprint becomes the gateway use case.

### NOT Our Customer (Yet)

- Non-technical users (too much config)
- Large enterprises (need compliance, SLAs, support)
- Developers wanting a framework (they'd use LangChain/CrewAI)

## 3. Core Value Prop vs. Alternatives

### The Competition Landscape

| Framework | What It Is | Target | Barrier |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| **LangChain** | Python library for LLM apps | Developers | Must write code |
| **CrewAI** | Python multi-agent framework | Developers | Must write code |
| **AutoGPT** | Autonomous agent experiment | Tinkerers | Unstable, experimental |
| **AutoGen** | Microsoft's agent framework | Enterprise devs | Azure-centric, complex |
| **AgentGPT** | No-code agent builder | Non-technical | SaaS, limited control |

### Our Position: "Infrastructure as Markdown"

We're not competing with frameworks. We're **bypassing** them.

**The insight:** OpenClaw already has the infrastructure (tools, scheduling, memory, messaging). You don't need another framework on top. You need the right *architecture* and *prompts*.

### Our Unfair Advantages

1. **Zero code required** — Config files and prompts only
2. **Production-proven** — This is what JC actually runs
3. **OpenClaw native** — Built for the platform, not adapted
4. **Immediate value** — Copy, customize, deploy in 1 hour
5. **Cost optimization built-in** — Opus/Sonnet tiering saves ~60% vs. Opus-only

### One-Line Positioning

> "The multi-agent system you'd build yourself — if you had 3 months. Ready in an hour."

## 4. MVP Scope for Initial Launch

### Must Have (v1.0)

- [ ] Core architecture documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] Agent role definitions (AGENTS.md)
- [ ] 4 SOUL templates (strategic, orchestrator, specialist, meta)
- [ ] Gateway config example (with spawning rules)
- [ ] Cron job examples (morning brief, weekly audit)
- [ ] README with quick start guide
- [ ] MIT License

### Nice to Have (Cut for v1)

- ❌ Video tutorials (text is enough)
- ❌ Industry-specific use cases (generic templates first)
- ❌ Advanced workflows (WORKFLOWS.md — defer)
- ❌ Deployment guide (DEPLOYMENT.md — defer)
- ❌ GUI/dashboard (never — stay config-native)

### v1.1 Candidates

- Shared memory patterns documentation
- 2-3 use case examples (executive assistant, content ops)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Community-contributed templates

## 5. Pricing Model

### Recommendation: Open Source Core + Premium Add-Ons

**Why Open Source?**

1. **OpenClaw is the monetization** — We drive OpenClaw adoption, OpenClaw benefits
2. **Community flywheel** — Users contribute templates, examples, improvements
3. **Trust signal** — MIT license = no lock-in, no gotchas
4. **Distribution** — GitHub visibility, SEO, forks = free marketing

### Where's the Money?

| Revenue Stream | Model | Price Point | Timeline |
|----------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Core system** | Free (MIT) | $0 | Launch |
| **Premium templates** | One-time | $49-199 per pack | v1.1+ |
| **Setup consulting** | Hourly | $200-500/hr | Now |
| **Custom agent dev** | Project | $2,500-10,000 | Now |
| **Sponsorships** | Monthly | $500-2,000/mo | If popular |
| **Course/workshop** | One-time | $199-499 | v2+ |

### Bootstrap Strategy

1. **Launch free** — Get users, get feedback, build reputation
2. **Consulting now** — People who want it done = immediate revenue
3. **Premium templates later** — When demand is clear
4. **Never paywall the core** — The architecture should stay free
